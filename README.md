#  Cat Application
So i was feeling very bored one night. And because i love cats, I thought they might bring fun and joy to other people as well during these covid-19 times.

For the code purists - i know you might hate the way the code is written - but i got a little crazy during the night and decided to make a challenge out of it. I aimed to keep it in only 1 class and as short as possible.
